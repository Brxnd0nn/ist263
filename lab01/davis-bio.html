        Hi My name is Brandon Davis. I’m a Junior Information Technology and Management Major with an interest in cyber security. I’m not necessarily super skilled or accomplished but I’ve spent a lot of time trying to build on my technological skills, which leads me into my hobbies and interests. I absolutely love Science and Technology (Hence why I’m studying it) but I often spend my time building things and playing games. I’ve also recently built a love for fitness and physical activities.
